Bank Loan Prediction


Overview

This project is a Bank Loan Prediction system that uses machine learning algorithms to predict whether a user is eligible for a bank loan based on their input data. The system is built using Python and its libraries, and includes data cleaning, preprocessing, and machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree and Random Forest. The system also includes a web interface built using Flask to provide a user-friendly experience.

Features

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The system includes data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure that the input data is in a suitable format for the machine learning algorithms.

Machine Learning Algorithms: The system uses Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms to predict whether a user is eligible for a bank loan.

Web Interface: The system includes a web interface built using Flask to provide a user-friendly experience for users to input their data and receive predictions.
